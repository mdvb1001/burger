"Eat da Burger"

https://nameless-basin-74447.herokuapp.com/

With this simple Bootstraps UI, the user can create, view and 'devour' burgers.
In addition, there are two api routes for full `(/api/burgers)` and selected
`(/api/burgers/:id)` burger data in JSON format.

The app uses a MySQL database, which is connected to the above Heroku link via
JawsDB add-on.

Bon appetit!
